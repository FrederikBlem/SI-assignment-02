# Reading Task 2: SOA
A reading assignment on Service Oriented Architecture.

1. On up to two pages, give an answer to the following questions, in text and diagrams, as appropriate:
* <b>What is SOA?</b>
<br>Service-Oriented Architecture is an approach to software development architecture. It outlines how to make software components reusable using interfaces. The applications of SOA make use of services available in the network.
* <b>Which are the main building blocks of SOA architecture?</b>
<br>
* <b>What are the advantages and disadvantages of applying it in enterprise applications development?</b>
<br>
* <b>Which basic principles should the developers of SOA consider?</b>
<br>"A service has four properties according to one of many definitions of SOA:[3]

    It logically represents a repeatable business activity with a specified outcome.
    It is self-contained.
    It is a black box for its consumers, meaning the consumer does not have to be aware of the service's inner workings.
    It may be composed of other services.[4]" - according to Wikipedia's [article on SOA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture).

2. There exists a document, known as SOA Manifesto, which defines six values of priority in the work of the developers of SOA. Write those values in your own priority order (these you find most important should be at the top of the list) and explain your arguments.

The original order:
* Business value over technical strategy.
* Strategic goals over project-specific benefits.
* Intrinsic interoperability over custom integration.
* Shared services over specific-purpose implementations.
* Flexibility over optimization.
* Evolutionary refinement over pursuit of initial perfection.
